Modified SpeedTree importer for Maya/Arnold

All the modifications so the plug-in can work properly.

Changes: 

The main SpeedTreeImporterTranslator is replaced with the “Arnold” code. 
So you don't have to switch the file type anymore (drag and drop is enough into the viewport) .

and a lot of other changes :)

How to install: 
Close Maya
Copy the plug-in folder into your C:\Users\*UserName*\Documents\maya\202*\ folder.
Start Maya and turn on the SpeedTree plug-in.
